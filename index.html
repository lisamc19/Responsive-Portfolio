      <p>Hello! My name is Lisa. I am currently gaining new skills and knowledge to begin my journey into the field of web development. I have always enjoyed working with computers and technology whether it be researching or simply browsing the web. While not studying or doing homework you can find me working out, baking, reading, and watching movies. I participate in various forms of exercise such as calisthenics, yoga, kick-boxing, elliptical and strength training.</p>
      <p>I have a twelve year old cat named Honey who enjoys hanging out with me while I code. Some of my favorite shows are Fuller House and Gilmore Girls. In my free time you can find me spending time with family and friends. I also love the outdoors and staying active. I am excited to start this new chapter of my life!</p>
