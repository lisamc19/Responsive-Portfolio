      <p>Hello! My name is Lisa. I just graduated from UNCC with my Bachelors of Science degree. I am now taking a web development course to gain skills and knowledge of the topic and possibly start a new career. When not studying or doing homework I enjoy working out, cooking, baking, reading, and watching Netflix. For exercise I do calisthenics, yoga, kick-boxing, hiking, jogging, elliptical and strength training.</p>

      <p>I have a twelve year old cat named Honey. Some of my favorite shows are Parks and Rec and The Office. My favorite kind of food is Indian food. I especially like Chicken Chettinad. I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I have a boyfriend named Matt who lives in Asheville. My boyfriend and I enjoy cooking and working out together. I love the outdoors and staying active</p>
